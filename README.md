# Transfer Files Through Clouds

This Python module provides a simple way to **download files from cloud URLs (e.g., Google Drive)** and **manage file transfers and extractions** within cloud storage environments, such as Google Drive mounted in Google Colab.

---

## Overview

The `TransferFiles` script performs the following tasks:

- Downloads a file from a specified cloud URL using HTTP streaming to avoid memory overload.
- Saves the downloaded file to a target directory in the cloud storage.
- Extracts ZIP archives to a specified folder.
- Copies files and directories between different locations within the cloud storage.

This script is particularly useful for:

- Automated dataset preparation.
- Managing large file transfers in cloud-based machine learning workflows.
- Organizing datasets and assets in Google Drive or similar environments.

---

## Code Highlights

- Uses the `requests` library for efficient file downloading with stream support.
- Utilizes shell commands (`unzip`) to extract compressed datasets.
- Employs Python's `shutil.copyfile` and `distutils.dir_util.copy_tree` for copying files and directories.
